## 🧠 What is LogicStamp?

LogicStamp is an open-source toolkit that converts React/TypeScript codebases into **structured, AI-ready context bundles** — enabling dramatically more accurate LLM-assisted development.

No more invented files.  
No more missing props.  
No more architecture-breaking hallucinations.

Used today by real developers in production-scale React/Next.js projects.
